# 📊 Hotel Data Analysis using Jupyter Notebook

This project analyzes hotel reservation data to uncover key business insights that can help improve **customer experience** and **increase sales**.

We use Python with Jupyter Notebook to explore the dataset, clean the data, visualize important trends, and derive meaningful conclusions.

---

## ✨ Objectives

* Understand reservation patterns across months
* Analyze cancellation rates
* Evaluate average daily rates (ADR) trends
* Provide insights for business decisions

---

## 📈 ADR (Average Daily Rate) Per Month

Visualizing how ADR changes month over month helps identify pricing trends and seasonal impacts on bookings.

## ❌ Reservation Cancellation Distribution

A pie chart to show the proportion of reservations that were canceled versus those that were not. This helps understand cancellation behavior.
